# Investment App Monorepo Audit Report

**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Audited by**: AI Development Assistant  

## üîç Executive Summary

This audit identifies critical dependency conflicts and monorepo structure issues in the investment application. The most urgent issue is the React version mismatch between mobile (React 19) and web (React 18) which causes compatibility problems.

## üö® Critical Issues Found

### 2023-11-15T14:30:00Z - Python API Backend Error - Missing Import

**Error encountered**:
```
NameError: name 'InvestmentPlan' is not defined. Did you mean: 'Investment'?
```

**Root cause analysis**:
In the `admin.py` router file, the `InvestmentPlan` schema was being used but was not imported from the schemas module.

**Resolution**:
Added `InvestmentPlan` to the import statement in `admin.py`:
```python
from schemas.schemas import User, UserUpdate, UserRole, Document, DocumentStatus, Investment, InvestmentStatus, InvestmentPlan
```

**Verification step**:
Running the Python API backend again to verify the fix.

**Next action**:
Fix the next error that appeared.

### 1. React Version Conflict (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Mobile**: React 19.0.0 + React DOM 19.0.0
- **Web**: React 18.2.0 + React DOM 18.2.0
- **Impact**: Shared components fail, build inconsistencies, runtime errors
- **Action**: Downgrade mobile to React 18.2.0 (Expo 53 supports it)

### 2. React Native Version Mismatch (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Current**: `react-native@0.79.3` (standalone)
- **Expected**: Expo SDK 53 includes React Native 0.75.x
- **Impact**: Metro bundler conflicts, native module incompatibilities
- **Action**: Remove standalone react-native, let Expo SDK manage it

### 3. Missing API Package (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Current**: API routes embedded in web app (`src/app/api/`)
- **Expected**: Dedicated `apps/api` with Hono server
- **Impact**: Poor separation of concerns, difficult deployment
- **Action**: Extract API to separate package

### 4. Custom Dependencies (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: `react-native-calendars` uses custom GitHub tarball
- **Risk**: No version control, potential security issues
- **Action**: Find compatible published version or fork properly

### 5. Missing Monorepo Setup (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: No root package.json with workspaces
- **Impact**: No unified dependency management, complex dev setup
- **Action**: Create workspace root with pnpm workspaces

## üîß Dependency Version Conflicts

| Package | Mobile Version | Web Version | Status | Action |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| react | 19.0.0 | ^18.2.0 | ‚ùå Conflict | Align to 18.2.0 |
| react-dom | 19.0.0 | ^18.2.0 | ‚ùå Conflict | Align to 18.2.0 |
| @tanstack/react-query | ^5.72.2 | ^5.72.2 | ‚úÖ Match | Pin version |
| zustand | 5.0.3 | ^5.0.3 | ‚úÖ Compatible | Pin to 5.0.3 |
| three | ^0.166.0 | ^0.175.0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor diff | Align to latest |
| yup | ^1.6.1 | ^1.6.1 | ‚úÖ Match | Pin version |
| date-fns | ^4.1.0 | ^4.1.0 | ‚úÖ Match | Pin version |
| typescript | ~5.8.3 | ^5.8.3 | ‚úÖ Compatible | Pin to 5.8.3 |

## üì¶ Problematic Dependencies

### Mobile App Issues:
1. **@shopify/react-native-skia**: Using pre-release `v2.0.0-next.4`
2. **react-native-calendars**: Custom GitHub tarball instead of npm package
3. **yarn**: Included as dependency (should be dev tool)
4. **expo-three**: May conflict with different Three.js versions

### Web App Issues:
1. **@lshay/ui**: Unknown package, verify availability
2. **next-themes**: Override without using Next.js
3. **react-router-hono-server**: Unusual combination, verify compatibility

## üéØ Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. ‚úÖ **Create monorepo structure**
   ```bash
   # Create root package.json with workspaces
   # Add unified scripts for dev/build/test
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Align React versions** 
   ```bash
   # Mobile: Downgrade React to 18.2.0
   # Verify Expo 53 compatibility
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Fix React Native setup**
   ```bash
   # Remove standalone react-native
   # Let Expo SDK manage RN version
   ```

### Phase 2: Structure Improvements (Week 2)
4. ‚úÖ **Extract API package**
   ```bash
   # Create apps/api with Hono + Node.js
   # Move API routes from web app
   ```

5. ‚úÖ **Create shared packages**
   ```bash
   # packages/ui - Shared components
   # packages/types - TypeScript definitions
   # packages/config - Shared configs
   ```

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)
6. ‚úÖ **Resolve custom dependencies**
7. ‚úÖ **Add development tooling**
8. ‚úÖ **Create unified build pipeline**

## üõ† Tools & Package Manager

**Recommended**: `pnpm` for workspace management
- Better disk usage than npm/yarn
- Faster installs
- Strict dependency hoisting
- Built-in workspace support

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Execute Phase 1** immediately to resolve critical conflicts
2. **Set up local development** with unified scripts
3. **Test all apps** work together after fixes
4. **Document new architecture** for team onboarding

## üìû Support

If issues persist after implementing fixes:
1. Check console for specific error messages
2. Clear Metro/Vite cache: `pnpm clean && pnpm dev`
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Review this audit for missed dependencies

## 2025-09-06 - Alembic Migration Path Error and Fix

**Error encountered:**
```
FAILED: No 'script_location' key found in configuration.
```

**Root cause analysis:**
Alembic could not find the migration scripts because the `script_location` was not set or the `migrations/versions` directory did not exist.

**Resolution:**
- Verified that `alembic.ini` had `script_location = migrations`.
- Created the missing `migrations/versions` directory.
- Re-ran `alembic upgrade head` to apply migrations.

**Instructions for future issues:**
- Ensure `alembic.ini` has the correct `script_location`.
- The `migrations/versions` directory must exist for Alembic to track migration scripts.
- If you see this error, create the missing directory and retry the migration command.

## 2025-09-07 Web Frontend Routing Issue

**Error encountered:**
Web application routing was not properly handling dynamic route parameters, causing navigation issues with parameterized routes.

**Root cause analysis:**
The route parameter handling in multiple files had regex pattern issues that prevented proper parsing of:
- Catch-all parameters (e.g., [...slug])
- Optional parameters (e.g., [[id]])
- Regular parameters (e.g., [id])

**Resolution:**
- Fixed route-builder.ts to properly handle all parameter types with correct regex patterns
- Updated routes.ts to correctly process route segments with improved conditional logic
- Enhanced not-found.tsx to display route parameters in a more user-friendly format

**Instructions for future issues:**
- When adding new route types, ensure the parameter handling logic is updated in all three files
- Test all parameter types (regular, optional, and catch-all) when making routing changes
- Check both client-side and API routes when troubleshooting routing problems

## 2025-09-07 Authentication Configuration Issue

**Error encountered:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'secret')
```

**Root cause analysis:**
The Auth.js configuration was failing because the AUTH_SECRET environment variable was set to a JWT token format which is not compatible with what Auth.js expects. This caused authentication to fail when trying to sign in.

**Resolution:**
- Updated the AUTH_SECRET in the .env file to use a simple string format
- Created a script to add a default admin user with credentials: email: admin@platform.com, password: admin

**Instructions for future issues:**
- Ensure AUTH_SECRET is a simple string, not a JWT token
- When authentication errors occur, check the .env file for proper configuration
- Use the scripts/create-admin.js script to recreate the admin user if needed
